# Welcome to PANDR üêº

Welcome to **PANDR**, the Programming and Robotics club at the Thomas Hardye School.

**PANDR** builds on the legacy of the school's programming club and is now a student-led initiative independently managed by me, [Bruno Greenfield](https://github.com/BrunoGreenfield).

Feel free to check out our team projects that I've led, and the awesome work contributed by club members!
